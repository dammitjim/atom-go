# atom-go

Golang language plugin for atom, very much a work in progress.

Aims to be an all-in-one package.

## TODO list

* Sort out built executables
* Golint
* Govet
* Gocode integration
* Config page
* Project manager integration
* Recognize GB projects and set pathing accordingly
* Go test integration

## Things to sort out

* Performance
* Proper error logging, what needs notifications?
* Windows support, maybe.
